          <h3>At the gate</h3>
          <p>The night before your flight, you saved everything — lounge access, packing tips, what to do when a layover stretches to six hours. Now you're at the gate. Wi‑Fi is a joke. You type "long layover" and there it is. Your future self, thanking your past self.</p>

          <h3>That article. You know the one.</h3>
          <p>You swore you'd remember. That piece about productivity, or the tool that was supposed to change everything. You don't remember the title. Or the site. You just remember: it had something to do with time and calendars. So you ask. And it finds it.</p>

          <h3>Big day tomorrow</h3>
          <p>You've been saving notes for weeks. Interview prep. Company research. Quotes you wanted to use. The night before, you're nervous. You ask: "What did I save about their culture?" It's all there. Your own prep, talking back to you.</p>

          <span class="case-icon">🌙</span>
          <h3>11pm. You're stuck.</h3>
          <p>You're learning something new. You saved a dozen tutorials. You hit a wall. "Where did I read about fixing this error?" Your saved content answers. No opening 47 tabs. No "where was that again?" Just the answer, from what you already saved.</p>

          <span class="case-icon">💚</span>
          <h3>A note from past you</h3>
          <p>You saved a recipe for your mom. A health article you wanted to share. A tip for your kid's project. Months later, you need it. You type what you remember. It finds it. Like a little note from past you, waiting when you needed it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case">
          <span class="case-icon">📚</span>
          <h3>Essay due tomorrow</h3>
          <p>You've been saving papers, notes, and quotes all semester. The bibliography is a mess. You ask: "Where did I save that study about sleep and grades?" It resurfaces. Your semester's work, organized when you need it most.</p>
