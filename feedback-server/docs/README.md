# Docs Index

This folder is intentionally minimal in GitHub.

Committed file policy:
1. Keep only this `docs/README.md` in version control.
2. Keep working product documents (MVP plans, promotion scripts, implementation drafts) local and ignored.

If documentation needs to be shared publicly, summarize it in:
1. Root `README.md` for product + repo overview.
2. This file for docs policy and pointers.
